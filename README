BME280

Reads data from a sensor hooked on IÂ²C bus on a raspberry pi.
Data output can be adjusted to some degree to the needs.
Timestamp can be included in the output.
The programming language c was choosen as it results in small,
fast and efficient program with small memory footprint. Depends
only on i2c lib, math lib and basic glibc stuff.
This makes it suitable for raspberry pi nano.

The program required approximately 170 ms total time per cycle.
In continous mode this is approximately 8 measurements per second.
If the precision is released by reducing oversampling,
it may result in a much higher output freqency.

It can be launched by cron and output can be redirected to a file
that can be used for exampe for gnuplot or d3. Or output may be fed
into a monitoring software like zabbix.

command line options:
  -H   print data header
  -h <nnn>  (optional) height in m above NN, defaults to 0 m
  -d <device>   (optional) i2c device defaults to /dev/i2c-1
  -2    (optional) use alternative i2c-address 0x77 instead of default 0x76
  -f [seconds|iso|none]   timestamps in either seconds, ISO 8660 format (default) or none
  -t [space|comma|semi]   output values with given separator (default is space)
  -u   output unit after each value (default is no unit)
  -c   loop endless (default one time only)


Example output with header:
--x--
time temperature pressure humidity pressureNN
2019-10-07T18:02:00 19.72 980.33 43.44 1019.83
--x--

Example output without timestamp and with header:
--x--
temperature pressure humidity pressureNN
19.71 980.59 43.74 1020.10
--x--
